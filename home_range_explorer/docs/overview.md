## Exploring Seasonal and Annual Home Ranges

The concept of an animal's home range, defined as the area traversed by an individual during its normal activities of food gathering, mating, and caring for young, forms a cornerstone of ecological research. Understanding the spatial extent and patterns of animal movement is crucial for addressing a wide array of ecological questions, including habitat use, social interactions, population dynamics, and conservation strategies. In an era marked by increasing human impact on natural environments, the ability to accurately delineate and analyze home ranges is more critical than ever, informing management decisions aimed at mitigating human-wildlife conflicts and ensuring the persistence of biodiversity.

The Home Range Explorer was designed to assist with this process by providing a simple way to explore seasonal and annual home ranges using a variety of approaches. Specifically, the app will help with the following tasks:

1.  Upload movement, segmentation, and disturbance data
2.  Visualize and compare annual and seasonal home ranges using alternative estimators
3.  Save home ranges as layers within a geopackage file for use with a GIS

## Select data

In this step, the user uploads spatial data into Movement Explorer.

**Select source dataset** offers two options:

1. **Use demo dataset** - This dataset is embedded in the app and is for a watershed located in the southeast Yukon / northcentral BC. It includes all spatial layers required to run the app. If selected, click the **Load data** button to load the demo dataset. Once loaded, the spatial layers will appear in a map and can be turned on and off. From here, you can view information about the movement data in the three tabs on the right, or you can move on to **Explore data**.
   
2. **Upload your own data** - If selected, the panel options will expand.

   - **Movement data (csv)**: Browse the animal movement data for the study area.
   
   - **Source of season/migration data** offers two options:
   
     - **Included in uploaded CSV** - If selected, the panel options will expand.
     
     - **Set the season column**: Select from the attribute names in the dropdown list.
     
     - **set the migration column**: Select from the attribute names in the dropdown list.
   
   - **From external file** - If selected, click on the Browse button to select a **Season and migration file (csv)**.
   
3. **Disturbance data (gpgk)**: Browse to the GeoPackage for the study area and click "Open".

ðŸ“Œ Users are responsible for ensuring that all required spatial layers (and associated attributes) are included in the Geopackage and that all layers share a consistent coordinate reference system.
  
Refer to the **Dataset Requirements** tab for a detailed description of required and optional layers, as well as their respective data structure.

Press the **Load data** button to load the spatial layers. The layers will appear in a map where the user can turn layers on and off. From here, you can view information about the movement data in the three tabs on the right, or you can move on to **Explore data**.

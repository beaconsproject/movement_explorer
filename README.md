# Issues

- line and poly do not work with <<-
- Fix clip and save disturbances when saving data
- Can we add to existing geopackage?
- Add stats windows
- Convert maps to cards
- Can we link the two maps so they zoom in and out together

# Wish list

- Select years non-consecutively e.g., 2021 and 2023 to see if there are similar migration patterns.
- Have two windows in the "Ranges" and "Corridors" tabs to allow for visual comparisonz.
- Any way to have a slider that controls window size to enable consistent screen captures.
- What about a scale control e.g., 1:20,000
- Can shiny do screen captures?
- Inset map

# Case study 1 - Comparing summer and winter ranges

- By what percentage has landscape intactness changed in the summer and winter ranges?
- What is the proportion of linear and areal disturbances in the summer and winter ranges?
- Has the amount of burned area in the summer and winter ranges increased since the start of sampling?

# Case study 2 -

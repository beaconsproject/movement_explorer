## Exploring Range and Occurrence Distributions

Understanding how animals migrate is crucial for conservation and for grasping the effects of environmental changes. The Movement Explorer app is a tool designed to visualize and analyze seasonal migration data, helping us uncover these patterns.

Specifically, the app will help with the following tasks:
1. Visualize animal locations and trajectories
2. Summarize GPS-based sampling characteristics
3. Visualize annual and seasonal home ranges using alternative estimators (e.g., KDE)

This section provides an overview of the app, explaining its purpose, how to use it, and the type of data it requires. A user guide is available in the next tab, offering step-by-step instructions to help you get started. Finally, the dataset tab provides the details you need to prepare your own dataset for use with the app.

Please note that the Movement Explorer app is intended to provide users with a simple way to visualize movement data and explore patterns e.g., movement corridors and high use areas. It is not intended to be used for data preparation and cleaning, nor for complex statistical analysis and modelling.

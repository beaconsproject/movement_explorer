## segmentation_explorer

- at minimum it should convert population-level segments table (M-D) to an individual-level segments table (DOY)
- remove "day1" and replace with code that checks for seasons that cross year e.g., early winter
- after converting to DOY it should save as csv and open in Excel so that user can edit

## home_range_explorer

## Exploring movement data

The **Explore data** section allows the user to view the movement data interactively along with some underlying disturbance and conservation datasets described in the **Datasets requirements** help tab. Three filters are provided allowing the user to select individuals, seasons, and a range of years:

**Select individual:** Select an individual animal by its id or all of the animals by choosing "ALL".

**Select individual:** Select a season or migration period by its name or all of the seasons by choosing "ALL".

**Select year(s):** Select a range of years by moving the two sliders.

When you are ready, click on **Map data** to view the movement data. Subsequently, anytime you change one of the selections, the map will update immediately without needing to click the button.
